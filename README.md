# Functions for the analysis of extreme wind gusts in Australia from multiple processes, from various data sources

### Including the analysis of measured and reported severe convective winds from reanalysis. 

For an indication of how these scripts are used in Brown and Dowdy (2021a), see [log.md](https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis/blob/master/log.md)
	
### And analysis of severe convective wind environments from the CMIP ensemble
For method of Brown and Dowdy (2021b) see [cmip/log.md](https://github.com/andrewbrown31/SCW-analysis/blob/master/cmip/log.md)
